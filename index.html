      <h2>STRESS</h2>
      <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
      <img src="stress.webp">
      <h3>Stress</h3><br>
      <p>Stress is the degree of force, that is to say, the muscular effort and energy with whitch we make a syllable
        sound as pronounced. When we stress a syllable, the muscles that we use to expel air from the lungs are often 
        more active, producing higher subglotal pressure.
      </p>
      <h3>Prominence</h3>
      <p>
        Prominence is determined by four factors <br>
        <h5>Lenght</h5>
        <p>Longer syllables are heard as stress, there is a distinction of short and long syllables</p>
        <h5>Pitch</h5>
        <p>Produced by the vibration and tension of the vocal folds. Auditorily it goes from lower to higher pitch</p>
      </p>
      <h5>Loudness</h5>
      <p>Produced by the muscular energy and breathforce. Auditorily, it goes from soft to loud</p>
      <h5>Quality</h5>
      <p> Produced by the shape of the resonators. Auditorily, weak or strong</p> 
      <h3>Levels of stress</h3>
      <p>Primary stress: most important kind of stress. It is produced by a pitch movement from lower to higher pitch.
         Examples:
        /əˈraʊnd/ </p> 
      <p>Secondary stress: weaker than primary stress but stronger than unstressed. We found it in transcription with a low mark.
         Example: /ʌnˈplɛz(ə)nt/
      </p>
      <p>Unstressed: does not carry any kind of stress</p>
      <h3>Placement of Stress</h3>
      <p>English has no fixed rules but it has a summary for some words. In order to place stress we have to follow four factors:
        1- Morphology of the word: simple or complex. <br>
        2- Grammatical category: noun, verb, adjective, adverb.<br>
        3- Phonological structure: weak or strong.<br>
        4- How many syllables the word has?<br>
      </p>

      <h2>Rhythm</h2>
      <h5>August 10, 2020</h5>
      <img src="rhythm.webp">
      <p>Roach states that English is rhytmical because it is detectable in the regular occurence of stressed syllables.
        English has a stress-timed rhythm because syllables happening at regular intervals of time wether they are separated
        by unstressed syllables or not. The theory states that the time taken from each stressed syllable to the next one will
        tend to be the same. English is said to exhibit isochrony, whitch is the property of being equally spaced in time. 
      </p><br>
      <h5>Foot</h5>
      <p>It is the unit of rhythm. It has been used for a long time in the study of verse meter. Each foot starts with a stressed syllable
        plus a unstressed one, the foot begins when another stressed syllable appear. <br><br>
        <h6>More info:</h6> Spanish has syllable-timed rhythm because the time taken to produce an utterance will be proportionate to
        the number of syllables it has since unaccented syllables in Spanish are less slightly weakened and shortened.

      <h2>Aspects of Connected Speech</h2>
      <img src="51305.jpg">
      <p>Connected speech occurs in rapid speech. Due to an economy of effort. The faster you speak, the less pauses you make.
        It occurs with consonants. It includes Assimilation, Elision, Contractions and Linking.
      </p><br>
      <h3>Assimilation</h3>
      <p>It occurs when two neighbour sounds comes to share the same characteristic</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Regressive Assimilation:</h3>
      <p>When a final consonant comes to share the place of articulation, mantaining the voice, with the initial consonant of the next word
      </p>
      <h3>Regressive Asimilation of Manner:</h3>
      <p>When a final consonant comes to share the manner of articulation with the inicial consonant of the nextt word</p>
      <h3>Progressive Assimilation of Voice:</h3>
      <p>When a final consonant comes to share the same voice with the inicial consonantof the next word</p>
      <h3>Coalescent Assimilation:</h3>
      <p>When a palato-alveolar + j form a post alveolar</p><br>
      <h3>Linking</h3>
      <p>When a Sf is linked to Si under certain circumstances</p><br>
      <h3>Linking r</h3>
      <p>When is suggested in spelling and the Si is a vowel </p>
      <h3>Intrusive j</h3>
      <p>When is not suggested in spelling and is followed by a vowel (To avoid hiatus)</p>
      <h3>Linking j</h3>
      <p>High front vowel + vowel</p>
      <h3>Linking w</h3>
      <p>Back vowel + vowel</p>
      <h3>Resyllibification </h3>
      <p>Consonant/Consonant clusters + vowel</p>
      <h3>Gemination</h3>
      <p>Consonant + consonant</p><br>
      <h3>Elission</h3>
      <p>In rapid speech and under different circumstances there are sounds elided</p>
      <p>* When there is a weak vowel after p, t, k <br>
         * When there is a weak vowel before n, l, r (becomes syllabic) <br>
         * The loss of "v" after consonants in of <br>
         * Contractions<br>
         * Consonant clusters (when they are 3 or 2 plosives together + a fricative, the plosive in the middle dissapears)
